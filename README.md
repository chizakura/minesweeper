# Project Overview

## Project Schedule

This schedule will be used to keep track of your progress throughout the week and align with our expectations.  

You are **responsible** for scheduling time with your squad to seek approval for each deliverable by the end of the corresponding day, excluding `Saturday` and `Sunday`.

## Project Description

Minesweeper is a stategy game where the player has to click all squares without clicking on a bomb. If a square is clicked, a number can be revealed to show if there are any bombs on the neighboring squares. A square is automatically cleared if there are no bombs.

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Title and board
- Click a square that shows either empty or bomb
- Add flags to board
- Click all empty squares to win

#### PostMVP 

- Number hints that show if a bomb is hidden nearby


Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Board | H | 1hr| 2hrs | - |
| Adding Squares and Bombs | H | 2hrs| 4hrs | - |
| Adding Flags | M | 2hrs| 3hrs | - |
| Adding Number Hints | L | 3hrs| 4hrs | - |
| Total | H | 8hrs| 13hrs | - |
